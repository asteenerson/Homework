I discovered that there is an issue with python displaying '$' since this is a command in github. '$' in github does not allow the table data to display properly. To ensure the data frames display correctly in github this you can escape the '$' command by instead typing '/$'. 

'/$' will show up as '$' in Jupyter however in github it shows up as '/$'. Although there is a / in the table cell it at least displayed the data frame correctly.
