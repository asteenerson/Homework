I discovered that there is an issue with github displaying '$' since this is a command in github. '$' in github does not allow the table data to display properly. To ensure the data frames display correctly in github you can escape the '$' command by instead typing '\$'. 

'\$' will show up as '$' in Jupyter however in github it shows up as '\$'. Although there is a \ in the table cell it at least displays the data frame correctly. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
