Three trends based on the Pyber data
1.	Although urban areas make up the majority of Pyberâ€™s total fares, rural and suburban areas have higher average fares per ride.
2.	Suburban areas may be the best area for drivers since suburban areas have higher fares but have less driver competition than urban areas. 
3.	The further customers live from urban areas the more likely they will need a longer trip equating to higher fares.
